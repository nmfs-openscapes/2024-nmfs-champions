# 2024 NMFS Champions 

Welcome to the 2024 NMFS Openscapes Champions Program for NOAA’s National
Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). This is the website for the three NOAA Fisheries
Cohorts running concurrently in Fall 2024 with research teams and
individuals from across NMFS Centers and Offices.

## Coworking times (optional)

Coworking sessions are where get our own work done at the same time
together. Sometimes, this means quiet work with check-ins to break up
focused work and get feedback, and sometimes this involves asking
questions and screensharing to learn and problem solve. We will make
breakout rooms in Zoom so people working on related themes can meet and
learn from each other.

Participants across all three Fall 2024 NMFS Openscapes Champions
Cohorts are welcome and encouraged to join a Coworking session in the
weeks between Cohort Calls.

**Coworking Date-Times:**   
Tuesdays and Thursdays 12:00 -1:00 pm PT every second
week: Oct 15, 17, 29\*, 31, Nov 12, 14, 26, 28.   
\*Tuesday Oct 29 will be 11:00 - 12:00 PT.

## Participating teams and individuals

Some brief information about participants. Please add any edits directly
(we’ll learn how in our GitHub Clinic!)

1. **PIFSC Socioeconomics**: My name is Crystal Dombrow and I analyze socioeconomic cost-earnings survey data from small boat fisheries in the Pacific Islands region.
2. **Alaska HCD**: Our team works on EFH in AK. We are interested in learning best practices for data workflow and report writing. You can see more here: [Alaska Essential Fish Habitat](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/habitat-conservation/essential-fish-habitat-efh-alaska).

- [**NMFS Openscapes Champions
  Cohorts**](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/champions.html)
- [**Our path to better science in less time using open data science
  tools**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160) (Lowndes et
  al. 2017) - This describes a marine science team’s transition to open
  collaborative teamwork. It was the original inspiration for creating
  the Champions Program and heavily influences the Core Lessons. We’ll
  ask that everyone participating reads it before our first Cohort Call.
- [**Supercharge your research: a ten-week plan for open data science**](https://openscapes.github.io/supercharge-research/) (Lowndes et
  al. 2019) - This was co-authored with the inaugural Champions Cohort,
  capturing the most valuable take-aways for marine and environmental
  science early career faculty.
- [**Shifting institutional culture to develop climate solutions with
  Open Science**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.11341) (Lowndes
  et al. 2019) - This was co-authored by Openscapes mentors across
  organizations – including NASA Earthdata, NOAA Fisheries, EPA,
  California Water Boards, Pathways to Open Science, Fred Hutch Cancer
  Center.
